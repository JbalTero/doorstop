# TODO

**Bunch of improvement left to do related to the Doorstop GUI**

## Bug
- Adding an item, immediately create a file on disk without explicit save
- Removing an item, immediately remove file from disk without explicit save

## GUI Improvement
- Make view fit in screen (or add scroll bar)

### GUI Improvement, No Can Do
Need investigation, but the following may not be possible to implement:
 - Make item strikethrough (or italic) in the tree when they are not active.
 - Make item bold in the tree when they are Heading.

**Since:**
- A treeview only accepts 1 font (can't specify a font per cell)
 - Source: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/comp.lang.tcl/85-TWOhcCOA
- tkinter only accept Unicode character up to FFFFFF

## Code quality
- Add Mypy lint to build process
 - Add Mypy types to all functions
- Add python documentation to every method.
- Review naming convention (use lint tool to identify them.. pep8)
- Unit test Action, Reducer, Store, State.
- Test environment corner case situation (readonly folder, ...)

## User friendliness
- Add scroll bar to every widget
- Make tree node draggable and reorderable with the mouse

## Missing feature
- Add help in menu
 - Help > About
 - Help > GUI Help
 - Help > DoorStop project
 - Short cut (F1)
- Add Raw Edit in text editor.
- Add the possibility to add document.
- Add the possibility to remove document.
- Add a warning/issue list view.

## User Accessibility
- Isolate all text
- Add a switch language in the menu.
- I18n English
- I18n other languages

## Idea
- Search feature
- Unify command line (GUI/CLI able to connect to remote/local data)
