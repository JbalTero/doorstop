# TODO

**Bunch of improvement left to do related to the Doorstop GUI**

## Bug
- The add Item button does not works anymore (must be implemented)
- The remove Item button does not works anymore (must be implemented)

## GUI Improvement
- Have a view (readonly or something else... like a welcome page) when no document is loaded
- Menu font size does not adjust when increasing/decreasing font size.
- Make view fit in screen (or add scroll bar)
- If link inception is empty or already existing, the add link button should be disabled.
- Make item strikethrough (or italic) in the tree when they are not active.
- Make item bold in the tree when they are Heading.

## Code quality
- Add Mypy lint to build process
 - Add Mypy types to all functions
- Add python documentation to every method.
- Review naming convention (use lint tool to identify them.. pep8)
- Unit test Action, Reducer, Store, State.
- Test environment corner case situation (readonly folder, ...)
- Review what is logged, what should vs should not be logged by the GUI

## User friendliness
- Make view fit in screen (add scroll bar to every widget)
- Make tree node draggable and reorderable with the mouse
 - Remove the Up/Down Arrows Buttons
- Make click-able links blue to make it more obvious that they are clickeable.

## Missing feature
- Add preview in menu
- Add publish in the menu
- Add export in the menu
- Add import in the menu
- Add help in menu
 - Help > About
 - Help > GUI Help
 - Help > DoorStop project
 - Short cut (F1)
- Add Raw Edit in text editor.
- Add the possibility to add document.
- Add the possibility to remove document.
- Add a warning/issue list view.

## User Accessibility
- Isolate all text
- Add a switch language in the menu.

## Idea
- Search feature
- Unify command line (GUI/CLI able to connect to remote/local data)
